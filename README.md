Team Zodiac Robotics is a group of young and passionate engineers who is determined to explore,learn and create projects that is going to make an impact on people's lives.We were on a lookout for some exciting and challenging projects which would satiate our interest in Robotics. We always wanted to be a part of challenging events. We have gained experience by working on different projects and by participating in many competitions at college, State and National level.

The whole idea of Zodiac Robotics was initially started by working on our first project called **Humanoid hand**. We built cost effective robotic arm that would help people to lift objects and place it in positions that are needed. The second project was **Mars Rover**, an autonomous rover for space exploration. We took up the project because it incorporated all the core engineering branches.The next project is **AgRoBo**, an agricultural robot that assist the farmers. We used the knowledge that we gained from Space robotics to explore the agricultural robotics.

## Humanoid Hand

A cost effective robotic arm that uses a camera to identify an object, pick it up and place it in the required position. One of our  projects which paved our way into more challenging events.

## Mars Rover
A space exploration rover which performs tasks such as autonomous task, equipment servicing, astronaut assitance and soil sampling.This was developed as a part of a competition called **Indian Rover Challenge**, which was conducted by Manipal Institute of Technology.

## AgRoBo
An agricultural robot that assist the farmers by performing tasks such as Area mapping, sapling/seed plantation, soil analysis and crop maintenance. This is the project that we are currrently working on.
